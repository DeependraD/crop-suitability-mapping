  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Agroforestry has the capacity to reduce the poverty, enhance livelihood, improve food security and mitigate the climate change impact. The agroforestry suitability mapping is performed using geospatial technology based on similar guideline documented by FAO for Land suitability mapping. The study aims for applying remote sensing and GIS technology towards various spatial (soil and environmental) datasets in Dumka district of Jharkhand, India to achieve a nutrient availability and agroforestry suitability map. The Landsat satellite data, ASTER DEM and decadal annual rainfall datasets were utilized to generate wetness, landuse/ land cover (LULC), elevation, slope, and rainfall map. LULC map was utilized to identify the open area land in which agroforestry suitability was evaluated. Various thematic layers such as soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), organic carbon (C), pH and sulphur (S) were used for generating nutrient availability map. The agroforestry suitability map was generated utilizing the layers viz. nutrient availability, slope, wetness, rainfall and elevation by GIS integration/modeling in ArcGIS 10.1 software by providing different weight to each thematic layer as per its importance in the study area. The thematic layer weight was calculated based on pairwise comparisons (a standard statistical procedure). Finally agroforestry suitability maps were generated in the form of high, medium and low grid with spacing (1km \texttimes{} 1km). We also generated poverty map, one of the complete watersheds in the part of the study area and drainage map in whole study area to understand its proximity toward high agroforestry suitability grid. The study shows that the total open area land grids were 3421 out of which 50\% of grid was found to be highly suitable towards agroforestry. Furthermore a watershed, drainage pattern and poverty map were analyzed based on its proximity toward high agroforestry suitability. The study reveals high agroforestry suitability land grid proximity towards high poverty grid was approximately more than 70\%, whereas the proximity to the drainage pattern was roughly 60\%. One of the completed watershed in the part of the study area evaluation reveals approximately 50\% of the watershed area grid has the proximity of high agroforestry suitable land grid. The high agroforestry suitability and its proximity/relationship with high poverty, drainage pattern and in watershed based analysis provides golden opportunity to the local poor people to harness agroforestry practices by adopting intensive soil and water conservation measures if supported by sufficient funds/technology will largely help in mitigating poverty and enhancing the livelihood. The ongoing agroforestry projects can be further extended in the open areas of high agroforestry suitability grid for long term benefits of diversified output.},

  abstract = {Land suitability evaluation (LSE) is a valuable tool for land use planning in major countries of the world as well as in Malaysia. However, previous LSE studies have been conducted with the use of biophysical and ecological datasets for the design of equally important socio\textendash economic variables. Therefore, this research has been conducted at the sub national level to estimate suitable agricultural land for rubber crops in Seremban, Malaysia by application of physical variables in combination with widely employed biophysical and ecological variables. The objective of this study has been to provide an up\textendash to date GIS-based agricultural land suitability evaluation (ALSE) for determining suitable agricultural land for Rubber crops in Malaysia. Biophysical and ecological factors were assumed to influence agricultural land use were assembled and the weights of their respective contributions to land suitability for agricultural uses were assessed using an analytic hierarchical process. The result of this study found Senawang, Mambau, Sandakan and Rantau as the most suitable areas for cultivating Rubber; whereas, Nilai and Labu are moderately suitable for growing rubber. Lenggeng, Mantin and Pantai are not suitable for growing rubber as the study foresaw potential environmental degradation of these locations from agricultural intensification. While this study could be useful in assessing the potential agricultural yields and potential environmental degradation in the study area, it could also help to estimate the potential conversion of agricultural land to non\textendash agricultural uses.},

  abstract = {Cocoa is a major cash crop in Nigeria making the country the leading exporter and second largest producer of cocoa in the world in the 1960's. However, cocoa production has dropped significantly due to inadequate land information resulting to poor utilization of land and marginal crop yield. Thus, land suitability assessment based on the FAO Land Framework was carried out for cocoa in Ife Central Local Government Area using Geospatial techniques, soil diagnostics survey, and Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE). Soil samples were collected and analysed using standard methods; while other ancillary data with spatial attributes were prepared and analysed using appropriate geospatial techniques. All the data was integrated into a work geo-database from which spatial queries and multi-criteria analysis were carried out. The result of the analysis revealed that 19.44\% (28.26 km2) and 25.67\% (36.45 km2) are moderately and marginally suitable respectively while 54.38\% (77.29 km2) of the study area is not suitable. Some of the constraints affecting the crop suitability are unsuitable soil textures, low organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and cation exchange capacity (C.E.C). Therefore, this study recommends effective soil management and nutrient enrichment to increase yield and promote sustainable cocoa production.},

Land suitability analysis is a method of land evaluation, which measures the degree of appropriateness of land for a certain use. The present study is a qualitative evaluation of land to determine land suitability in Ghatal block, Paschim Medinipur district, West Bengal for rice and wheat cultivation based on four pedological variables, like Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) status, soil reaction (pH), Organic Carbon (OC) and soil texture that are mandatory input factors for crop cultivation. All these factors have been rated based upon the proposed method of Sys et al. (1993). The qualitative approach given by FAO (1976) has also been used to classify the land on the basis of their suitability ranked classes (e.g. S1, S2, S3, N1 and N2). This study proposes an integrated methodology for analyzing and mapping of land suitability using the Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The result indicated that only 12.71\% of agricultural land can be demarcated as highly suitable for rice cultivation whereas 7.78\% of agricultural land as highly suitable for wheat cultivation in the study area.},

  abstract = {The present study comprehensively assessed soil site suitability for selected winter crops in the coastal saline agro-ecological environment of Sagar Island, India by integrating land limitation and crop suitability evaluation framework of FAO. Soil properties (e.g. texture, pH, organic carbon; SOC, electrical conductivity; EC and available macronutrients- NPK) were obtained through extensive grid based (size: 1 km by 1 km) soil sampling and estimation in the laboratory following standard procedures. Geo-statistical and visualization methods were applied to match the suitability for selected crops based on their essential soil quality requirements. The weights of the soil parameters have been assigned through PCA analysis, based on the relative importance of soil properties sensitive to crop specific growth and development. The inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpola\- tion and reclassification methods were adopted for generation of spatial layers of those soil properties. Results revealed that, nearly 61\% of the geographical area (14618 ha GA) of the Island is under agricultural landuse (AL), mostly dominated by lowland rice-fallow based mono-cropping system (76\% of AL) followed by rice-rice double cropping (in 14.8\% AL). Soil suitability analysis for growing winter crops within agricultural area revealed that 38.4\% (5607 ha) of AL is highly suitable (S1) for sunflower, 11.9\% of AL (1739 ha) for chilli, 6.8\% (987 ha) of AL for potato and only 1\% (150 ha) of AL is considered to be highly suitable for mustard crop cultivation. However, the predominant fine textured soils of the Island falls under moderately suitable (S2) category for growing chilli (85.1\% of AL), mustard (64.6\% of AL), sunflower (55.7\% of AL) and potato (53.0\% of AL) crops. More than one third of the soils within the agricultural landuse were found not optimum for growing potato, sunflower and mustard. Findings from the study can be harnessed in increasing crop area diversification and intensification with appropriate irrigation and crop management practices in Sagar Island and similar such coastal Islands.},

This study proposes an empirical methodology for analyzing and mapping of land suitability using the GIS techniques. The study area happens to be the Morobe province in the Papua New Guinea. This paper examines multi-criteria decision approach to determine land suitability for rice cultivation based on different variables, like topography (slope and aspect of the land), physical (texture, water holding capacity and depth) and chemical (pH, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus) soil properties, climate (temperature and rainfall) and land accessibility that are mandatory inputs to land suitability model. These parameters are obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, soil data base of PNG, monthly and annual temperature and rainfall data, respectively. ArcGIS 10 and Erdas 11 model builder/maker are used to construct the index model for rice land suitability analysis. The province of Morobe has been classified into five categories of rice suitability. The result indicates that only four percent (4\%) land can be demarcated as `high' and twenty one percent (21\%) as `medium high' suitability categories in the study area and the spatial expanse of all the five categories within the province are mapped and displayed.},

  abstract = {Land suitability assessment is essential for increasing production and planning a sustainable agricultural system, but such information is commonly scarce in the semi-arid regions of Iran. Therefore, our aim is to assess land suitability for two main crops (i.e., rain-fed wheat and barley) based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ``land suitability assessment framework'' for 65 km2 of agricultural land in Kurdistan province, Iran. Soil samples were collected from genetic layers of 100 soil profiles and the physical-chemical properties of the soil samples were analyzed. Topography and climate data were also recorded. After calculating the land suitability classes for the two crops, they were mapped using machine learning (ML) and traditional approaches. The maps predicted by the two approaches revealed notable differences. For example, in the case of rain-fed wheat, results showed the higher accuracy of ML-based land suitability maps compared to the maps obtained by traditional approach. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the areas with classes of N2 ({$\approx$}18\%{$\uparrow$}) and S3 ({$\approx$}28\%{$\uparrow$}) were higher and area with the class N1 ({$\approx$}24\%{$\downarrow$}) was less predicted in the traditional approach compared to the ML-based approach. The major limitations of the study area were rainfall at the flowering stage, severe slopes, shallow soil depth, high pH, and large gravel content. Therefore, to increase production and create a sustainable agricultural system, land improvement operations are suggested.},
